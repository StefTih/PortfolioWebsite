# Welcome to my Portfolio website

Hi, my name is Tihomir Stefanov. I am a third year student at King's College London studying Computer Science. Since I did not want to clutter my CV with all the information about my past projects and work done I've created this website portfolio interactively introduces the recruiter and any person interested in the work I have done in the past in a simple an effective way. 

## Technologies used

The website uses standard HTML and CSS plus REACT components. Most of the components are static, but there are some dynamic implementations such as [emailjs](https://www.emailjs.com/) for the messaging form and [toastify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toastify) for the fancy notifications.

## Feedback
I am always open for suggestions on improving it, so if you have any constructive feedback please send me a message through the website. Thank you in advance and hope you enjoy the content!
